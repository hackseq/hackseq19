## When? Where? What?  
We are having a Genomics Hackathon in Vancouver in 2019. 

The website for the event lives here: http://www.hackseq.com/

The twitter account for this event is [@hackseq](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&q=hackseq)

This event will be modeled on the [NCBI hackathon](https://github.com/NCBI-Hackathons) format.
